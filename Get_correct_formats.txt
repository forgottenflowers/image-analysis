"Stack is larger than 4GB. Most TIFF readers will only open the first image. Use this information to open as raw:
name=Untitled, dir=, width=2648, height=2648, nImages=2048, offset=375, type=ushort, byteOrder=big, format=0, url=, whiteIsZero=f, lutSize=0, comp=1, ranges=null, samples=1"

When dealing with TIFF image stacks larger than 4GB, many standard TIFF readers will only open the first image due to the 4GB file size limitation of the standard TIFF format. To access the entire stack, it's necessary to open the file as raw data and interpret the header information. This approach allows you to bypass the limitations of the TIFF reader and access the individual images within the stack. 
Here's a breakdown of why this happens and how to address it:

Problem:
4GB Limit:
Standard TIFF files use 32-bit offsets, which inherently limit their size to around 4GB. 
BigTIFF:
For larger files, the BigTIFF format, which uses 64-bit offsets, is needed to support files larger than 4GB. 

ImageJ's Behavior:
ImageJ, when saving TIFF stacks larger than 4GB, often uses a non-standard format where it saves a fake TIFF header with the first image and then appends the rest of the image data (as raw data) to the end of the file. 

Reader Limitation:
Many image readers are not designed to handle this non-standard format and will only recognize the initial header, effectively displaying only the first image. 
Solution: Open as Raw
1. Identify the Image Properties:
You'll need to know the image's dimensions (width and height), the number of images (nImages), the data type (e.g., byte, short, float), and byte order (big-endian or little-endian). 
This information is often provided in the log message generated when saving the file or in a separate metadata file. 
For example, ImageJ might provide this information when it saves a large TIFF stack. 
2. Use a Raw Image Reader:
Use a software or script that allows you to open a file as raw data and specify the header information. 
For example, in Matlab, you could use functions like fopen, fread, and reshape to read the raw data and reconstruct the image stack. 
Specialized libraries like TIFFStack (GitHub) DylanMuir/TIFFStack: Support for ImageJ's fake TIF files, when file size is > 4Gb · Issue #7 · DylanMuir/TIFFStack or other tools designed for handling BigTIFFs or raw image data might be necessary. 
3. Handle the File Structure:
If the TIFF stack was saved with a raw data section appended to the end (as is common with ImageJ), you'll need to read the raw data accordingly, potentially skipping the initial TIFF header. 



ImageJ can generally open TIFF files it has created, but it might encounter issues with certain TIFF types, especially those created with specific configurations or those exceeding certain size limitations. ImageJ's own TIFF reader has limitations and might not handle all valid TIFF files correctly, including some that are written by other software. 

ImageJ's TIFF Reader:
ImageJ has a built-in TIFF reader that is known to be fast but has limitations. It may not correctly open some valid TIFF files, especially those with out-of-order planes or those that are very large, according to the ImageJ website. 
"Fake" TIFFs:
ImageJ can create "fake" TIFF files where a single TIFF image is followed by a binary data file, and the whole thing is saved as a TIFF. This can cause issues when trying to open these files in other software or even in ImageJ itself if it's not using its own reader. 

Bio-Formats Plugin:
If you encounter problems opening a TIFF file in ImageJ, it's often recommended to use the Bio-Formats plugin, which is more robust in handling different TIFF variations and other file formats. 
Alternatives:
If you're still having trouble opening a file, other image processing software like GIMP or QuPath might be able to handle it.

A thread:
https://forum.image.sc/t/convert-vff-format-to-tiff/82974
- Hi Curtis, our image processing team needs to import an image sequence in volume or VFF format and save or export as TIFF. How do we do this in ImageJ. We have been using Dragonfly, but were hoping that the ImageJ team could help us do this diectly in ImageJ. Is there a plugin for this perhaps?
- The first thing I would suggest is to try to use Fiji to open your VFF file, then save the resulting image to a TIFF. Fiji comes with Bioformats, which says it can open VFF files, so I’m hopeful that it will be straightforward.
- Hi, I tried to open the image sequence in both ImageJ and Fiji and also tried Bioformats. The software does not recognize .vol or .vgi formats, even using bioformats. Any suggestions?
- are your vgi/vol related to x-ray images processed with VGStudioMax (.vgi some kB, .vol several GB size)? If not, skip reading.

The .vgi is plain text, open it with Drag and Drop to the “>>”-Button (rightmost button) or in any text editor. The *.vol is a binary file, open it with File / Import / Raw… and enter the values you find in the *.vgi:

Image type: search for “bitsperelement”, “datatype” and “data range”, e.g. for “bitsperelement = 16”, “datatype = unsigned integer” and “datarange = 0 65535” you use Image type “16-bit Unsigned”
Width, Height, Number of images: look for “Size” and take the 3 numbers in this line
Offset to first image = 0
Gap between images = 0
Little-endian byte order = ticked
Before saving the tiff take the values in the lines starting with “resolution” and “unit” and set Pixel width / Pixel height / Voxel depth according to these values.

There may be mirroring necessary search for “Mirror = 0 0 0”, if one of these is a 1 the corresponding dimension is mirrored. You need enough memory, at least the size of the *.vol (x × y × z × bit-depth), otherwise open it as virtual stack.

Guenter Pudmich

------------- 01.09.2025 (OME Tiffs) (SuperMicro)

Everything worked great and I have all the fake tiffs. Now I try to convert them to OME tiffs using parallel processing on PowerShell.
I have already created a new folder inside C:/opt/ called Fiji_Shreya, and added to the library. (copy this to personal hard drive)
> Just look for and open windows powershell
> Set path to the directory with all the tiff files: cd E:/soleil_recon/trial_data/tiffs
> Copy-paste the main code (with correct paths) to the same directory as well
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
  (run to allow script execution for this session only)
> convert_fake_tiffs.ps1

Had to copy paste everything and save as "All files" not .txt files. I think its a Supermicro problem that doesn't allow to view and edit extensions easily.

Next, updating Power Shell, coz 'Parallel' variable wasn't recognized.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5
Ok doesn't work without admin rights. Updating script...

Manually had to edit Java Home environments in the .bat files. Nope doesn't work.
